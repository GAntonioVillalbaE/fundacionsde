        Our beautiful Cartagena de Indias, one of the most beautiful cities in Colombia and the world, is also home to thousands of children who lack the basic necessities to develop properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day in February 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic, we received in our group of friends, the photograph of a child, which showed the evidence of his virtual classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The photo showed the child in a rather modest house, with dirt floors and wooden walls, surrounded by his school work taped on the wall and a makeshift table to do his homework. The image not only showed the child's dedication and commitment to his learning, but also his parents' love and desire to excel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The photo managed to impact us and wrinkle our hearts so much that we decided to join forces to create a Foundation that could help children in the same condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We contacted the child's teacher and she told us about the conditions in which many of her students lived and the problems that afflicted them. Since then we visited their community and started working with them. We started carrying out different welfare activities, at the same time that we were advising and organizing ourselves legally until we achieved what today is our Foundation, created to bring joy and a seed of hope to all those children that many times do not have any opportunity to get ahead.
